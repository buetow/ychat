To do for next RELEASE:
- Flood protection
- Make CLI accessible through a chat command /cli
- Fixing logging bug (do not log any timestamps if there are no messages)
- Remove sess.cpp, use sman.cpp only.

To do in general:
- Remove user.cpp member variables as possible and replace them with hash maps 
  for (integer,mutex) and (string,mutex) pairs. Maybe use s.t. like this:
  p_user->val("name"); to get the users name and p_user->val("name","val"); to
  reset his name. Maybe use templates to get different types besides strings:
  p_user->val<int>("hits");
