Already done for next RELEASE:

Might do's for next feature RELEASE:
- Flood protection
- Remove sess.cpp, use sman.cpp only.
- Add /nick, /beam, /su
- Improve /ko, /msg, so they can used on several users at once with /ko (user1,user2)
- Improve /ko, so that there can be a reason specified as well.
- Add / to whisper to the last person to whom the user has been whispered the last time.
- Rename /getstatus into /about and add some infos such as user agent, ip number, hostname, etc. 
- Room maxuser limit.
- Add disable guest chatter option to ychat.conf

Bugs to be removed for next bugfix RELEASE:
