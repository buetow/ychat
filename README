1.0.0 REQUIREMENTS: 

- GNU GCC G++ 3.4 or 3.3 or 3.2 or 3.1 
  The GNU C++ compiler. G++ version 3.0 or 2.x does NOT work.

- GNU make 3.80 (gmake) or higher
  If you dont have a gmake executable but make is gnu make then you need
  to add a symlink or alias from gmake to make.
  yhttpd Makefiles only have been tested with GNU make and may not work with
  other make versions.

- mysql-client 4.x (3.x may do too but is not supported)
  Includes libmysqlclient and the mysql.h header files.

- ncurses 5.x   
  Includes libncurses and the ncurses.h header files.

- Screen
  Only needed if yhttpd should run in background with
  ncurses enabled.

- Perl 5.x
  Is needed for some scripts. Is not needed if you use precompiled binaries.

1.1.0 TESTED PLATFORMS:

The following platforms have been tested with success. If you find out that
a listed platform did not work at all please contact me:

  Operating system (arch)	GNU G++		GNU make
- FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE (i386)	3.3.3 		3.80		
- FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE (i386)	3.3.4		3.80
- FreeBSD 4.10-RELEASE (i386)	3.4.1		3.80
- Gentoo Linux 2004.2 (i386)	3.3.2		3.80
- OpenBSD 3.6 MP (i386)		3.3.2		3.80
- Slackware Linux 10.0 (i386)	3.4.0		3.80 
- SUSE Linux 8.0, G (i386)	3.3.1		3.80

Other platforms like Linux based systems, other BSD-Systems or UNICES
are very likely to work too. 

1.2.0 IMPORTANT NOTICES:

Before you compile the source you have to be sure to use at least GCC
version 3.1 with pthreads enabled. ( Type gcc -v to check it ).
GCC 2.95 and 3.0 did not work while testing and WON'T BE SUPPORTED!
If you like to support yhttpd++, please write us an email and tell what 
you can/like/would help ;-]. Please also take a look at the yhttpd++
homepage which is located at http://www.yhttpd.org.

1.3.0 HOW TO OBTAIN YHTTPD++:

yhttpd can be downloaded as a source package or through CVS. 

The packages are located at http://www.yhttpd.org -> Sourcecode -> 
Packages or go to http://pub.buetow.org/yhttpd/CPP-yhttpd .

For CVS download type:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@buetow.org:/usr/home/cvs/cvsroot login
( You will be asked for a password. Use "just enter" ).

vs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@buetow.org:/usr/home/cvs/cvsroot co yhttpd
( The sources will be copied into your local folder )

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@buetow.org:/usr/home/cvs/cvsroot logout
( Logs your CVS session out ).

Now you may continue with the installation.

1.3.1 INSTALLATION:

Invoke "./configure". Afterwards you will get prompted with the before-compile
options of yhttpd. After choosing those options you are ready to type "gmake"
afterwards. 


You may also invoke gmake with the following options (the PREFIX can be set
in the yhttpd configurator which will be launched by the top configure script
or gmake config):

 gmake or gmake all (compiles everything, also modules)
 gmake base (only compiles the base)
 gmake base_start (only compiles the base and starts the server)
 gmake clean (cleans everything)
 gmake clean_base (only cleans the base obj and rpo files)
 gmake clean_modules (only cleans the modules .so files) 
 gmake config (runs yhttpd configurator)
 gmake deinstall (deinstalls yhttpd from PREFIX)
 gmake gpl (shows the GNU General Public License)		
 gmake help (shows all available yhttpd gmake targets)
 gmake install (installs yhttpd to PREFIX)
 gmake modules (only compiles modules)
 gmake mrproper (same as gmake clean plus removing all temp files) 
 gmake setup (runs all configure scripts and afterwards gmake all)
 gmake start (compiles everything and starts the server)
 gmake stats (generates yhttpd statistics)
 gmake uninstall (same as deinstall)
 gmake version (shows the current version of yhttpd)

Example: "gmake all install clean" compiles everything, installs it to PREFIX
and cleans the source directories.

Now its time to run the server with ./bin/yhttpd.

Aferwards point your webbrowser to http://yourip:port !

... have fun :-).

1.3.2 INSTALLATION QUICK START:

If you in hury, then you may just type gmake setup. In the yhttpd configurator
you may just choose all the default values. If done, yhttpd will get compiled
and is ready to run with ./bin/yhttpd! 


1.4.0 HOW TO USE SCREEN WITH YHTTPD:

If you are running yhttpd in ncurses mode you might want to install
the tool which is called "screen". This will enable you putting the
ncurses interface into the background, closing the terminal session
and reusing the interface later through another terminal. 

Just do:
 
 screen -S yhttpd ./bin/yhttpd ( creates a new session and starts yhttpd in it )
 ctrl+d+a ( will detach the yhttpd session )
 ( closing the terminal )
 ( opening a new terminal )
 screen -r yhttpd ( will return you to the yhttpd process )

Screen will terminate automaticaly if all processes in its sessions are 
terminated.

For a closer look read the screen manual page ( man screen ). 

1.5.0 CUSTOMIZATION:

If you like to customize the design/layout/language of yhttpd, you will have 
to edit src/msgs.h and src/glob.h before you compile the sources. Afterwards 
you can change the html-template files which are placed in the html/ 
subdirectory and the language-templates which are placed in the XML config 
file (etc/yhttpd.conf).

Notice, that you dont have to edit the src/glob.h file by hand any more, its
already done by the top ./configure script for you.

You can edit the etc/yhttpd.conf to fit your needs. If you dont want to change
the config file, then you also can use yhttpd start parameters.

Exmpl: ./bin/yhttpd -o chat.database.password secretpassword

You can also use multiple words for a specific option.

Exmpl: ./bin/yhttpd -o yhttpd.version "word1 word2 word3"

will overwrite the default database password value of the yhttpd.conf. You can
do this with every configuration element by adding several -o option value 
arguments to the start command.

Dynamic loadable modules can be found in the mods/ subdirectory. (chat 
commands are realized through modules too). Sources of modules can be found
in src/mods instead. If you want to create a new module just create a new
.cpp file and run in src/mods the ./configure script again. Next time
you run gmake your new module gets compiled.

All messages defined in the msgs.h file contain server messages only ( a chat
user never wont read them, only the administrator will get to see them ).

1.6.0 FILES:

etc/yhttpd.conf  - The yhttpd configuration file
html/*		- The html template files
src/*		- The yhttpd base sources
src/mods/*	- The dynamic loadable modules sources
scripts/*	- Some nice scripts needed for building & co.

The following is created by building yhttpd:
obj/*		- The object files of the compiled yhttpd base 
mods/*		- The compiled dynamic loadable modules
bin/yhttpd	- The yhttpd binary (linked by the object files)

Customizable source files (if changed you need to run gmake clean all) 
src/glob.h	- Contains some global building options
src/msgs.h	- Defines some server side messages


1.7 WRITING BUG REPORTS

How to submit a good bug report?

Send them to Bug@yhttpd.org.

First you should give the following information:
- yhttpd version, if CVS (or devel. tarball) then which day?
- operating system / distribution and it's version
- when did it crash? did you do something? can you reproduce the crash?

Getting backtrace of the crash also helps a lot, especially if yhttpd crashes 
randomly. If after crash you see text:

 "segmentation fault (core dumped)" 

It writes a file named "core" or "yhttpd.core" depending on your OS to directory
where you started yhttpd. If it doesn't print the "(core dumped)" or you can't
find the core file, you'll have to raise the limit for max. core file size
before running yhttpd. To do this, say:

 ulimit -c unlimited 

So, if you have the core file and GNU debugger (gdb), you can get the 
backtrace with:

 gdb ./bin/yhttpd yhttpd.core 
 bt 

Paste all the lines starting from line having #0 at the beginning.

Here's an example session:

 in reqp::parse(thrd*, std::string, std::map<std::string, std::string, 
 std::less<std::string>, std::allocator<std::pair<std::string const, std::string> > >&) ()
 (gdb) bt
 #0 0x0805c287 in reqp::parse(thrd*, std::string, std::map<std::string, 
 std::string, std::less<std::string>, std::allocator<std::pair<std::string
 const, std::string> > >&) ()
 #1 0x0806060f in sock::read_write(thrd*, int) ()
 #2 0x080612ba in thrd::run() ()
 #3 0x0805a3b8 in pool::run_func(void*) ()
 #4 0x0805a375 in pool::tpool_thread(void*) ()
 #5 0x281d44ae in _thread_start () from /usr/lib/libc_r.so.5
 (gdb) 

If you dont get such a gdb output, you need to recompile the yhttpd using
debuggig symbols. You can do it this way:

cd yhttpd
gmake mrproper
./configure -g3 -ggdb
gmake start
