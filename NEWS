::(12.02.05)::Released yChat 0.7.4. This release includes a code cleanup and a dynamic increasing thread pool. Also, some other thread pool and session engine improvements were made. The Makefiles got more organized and the HTTPD header has got a Content-length line. The Content-type text/plain is now also supported. The command line interface has got the ! (bang) operator. So you can run programs of your shell through yChat. The HTML interface has got a scrolling checkbox to de/activate the scrolling of the chat stream. Last but not least some bugfixes were made.
::(09.02.05)::Tagged yChat 0.7.4-PRERELEASE into CVS. The RELEASE will follow this week.
::(08.01.05)::We passed the build number 3000! 3000 times yChat has been compiled during the developing process since there are build numbers! Also the first steps have been made porting yChat/yhttpd to the Windows platform using Cygwin (yChat 0.7.4-CURRENT Build 3040 CYGWIN_NT-5.1 1.5.12 (0.116/4/2) i686). It runs without having installed Cygwin and having an 1MB cygwin1.dll file instead. There are still some issues (like dynamic modules [which means, that there are no chat commands and no color choser etc], command line interface, ncurses interface, database support) which do not yet run on Cygwin. But those issues will be resolved the next weeks. An alpha (experimental) binary yChat/Win32 release might be done also.
::(04.01.05)::First we wish all of you a happy new year. Second we have to announce that yhttpd 0.7-CURRENT now also has tested on an OpenBSD/i386 MP 3.6 box with success. Also yChat 0.7.4-CURRENT is now available from CVS.
::(29.12.04)::Released yChat 0.7.3-RELEASE. New features:  Added the /all command (Global system message), added FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE support, added chat.enableguest option. Renamed the /getstatus command into /about.  Fixed some bugs.
::(09.11.04)::Released yChat 0.7.2-RELEASE. New features: /morph. Added the new standard html template design.  Bugfixes: /away prints a . instead of a : if no away reason is given. /ko message was wrong. Displayed not room name of the user to be kicked out. /invisible command displayed wrong private messages. /getstatus had no help text. /msg and /s should now print the system time if printalwaystime == true. Added a blank to the /uptime message. /topic now prints the topic in the user's color.
- Fixed some typos.
::(06.11.04)::Released yChat and yhttpd 0.7.1-RELEASE. Added ${MAKE} to the Make file because some Linux distros dont use the "gmake" command for GNU make but just "make"! Modified the configure script to generate a make.version file.  Removed some typos from the ychat.conf.  Fixed the auto away message. This one will be posted in the room as public rather than only private to the auto-away-user. Fixed some documentation stuff for yhttpd because yhttpd does not need MySQL at all. Added the chat.maxlength.word option.
::(02.11.04)::We now provided a yhttpd-0.7.tar.bz2 file for download which is a source code package of the HTTP kernel of yChat. This one can be used as a stand alone web server. Also a yhttpd branch will be created for yhttpd as well. :) We also started to work on the 0.7.x-CURRENT versions which will become some day 0.8-RELEASE.
::(01.11.04)::We now provided a ychat-0.7.tar.bz2 file for download which is a source code package of the release we made yesterday. It also contains some fixes since then. You can download it on this site under Sourcecode -> Source packages -> CPP-yChat. :)
::(31.10.04)::After a long yChat 0.7-CURRENT developing phase we are proud to anounce yChat 0.7-RELEASE. By now, there may not any 0.7 release source packages for download available but you can fetch the release from the current cvs instead until source packages are available. This release has the biggest change log ever in yChat history. Here are some highlights: Included color switcher user interface, smart garbage collection engine, real MySQL support, nick registration + password protection, 	completly rewritten configure and Makefile scripts, perl script for source code stats, system_log and room_log, logout button, string replace for smileys e.g., additional CLI mode in parallel to the ncurses mode for the admin interface, memory watching, HTTP POST request handling in addition to POST request handling, CGI support, md5-summing of session ids to make reverse engineering of sessions harder, yhttpd generation script out of the yChat source tree, XML based configuration file, and lots of new configuration options which we can't list all here. yChat 0.7-RELEASE is known to compile and work correctly with GNU G++ 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. This announcement will be as well on Freshmeat.net on monday.
::(30.10.04)::yChat now has been tested on an OpenBSD 3.6 MP box with success. It has been compiled with GNU make 3.80 and GNU G++ 3.3.2. OpenBSD is now the 3rd operating system which is know to work with yChat. The other two tested OSes are still FreeBSD and Linux. All other UNIX and UNIX like operating systems should also work. But if you have tested it please write us an email to tell us about. ;)
::(26.09.04)::Renamed yChat Advanced 0.5 into yChat 0.6-RELEASE and yChat 0.6-CURRENT into yChat 0.7-CURRENT.
::(25.09.04)::Wow, this was probably the largest CVS commit ever except of the initial source imports. yChat now completely uses an XML 1.0 based configuration file (ychat.conf). This was a lot of work, but everything seems to work now. ;)
::(13.09.04)::Added the "Statistics"-Section to the site. This section includes statistics about the yChat source code. 
::(05.07.04)::Added the "Documentation"-Section to the site. From now on, the bug-reports and requirements can be found there.
::(02.07.04)::New homepage is online. We took the homepage perl script which is also used by www.buetow.org (which is my private homepage :-). Some day i will make this script also open source but this is not the right site to tell ;).
::(27.06.04)::The yChat team implemented a small perl script (makeyhttpd.pl) which takes the ychat source tree and generates an yhttpd source tree from it. And believe it or not, it also works. That means, we now can release yhttpd servers on each future yChat release. The conclusion of it is, that yChat and yhttpd releases will have excact the same version numbers from now on. 
::(26.06.04)::Passed the 2000th yChat build :-)
::(25.06.04)::The serious problems have not been very serious. The module loading handling is fixed. yChat 0.5 CURRENT (CVS) now uses GNU G++ 3.4. Also a lot of compilation optimations have been added.
::(23.06.04)::yChat is facing some serious problems in the module loading handling. So the 0.6 RELEASE will need some more time to restructure big parts of the source code. But then yChat will be even more modular and dynamic.
::(08.04.04)::Finally added the first yhttpd version (0.0 CURRENT) into the CVS repository. See Sourcecode -> CVS-Repository how to access those files.
::(20.03.04)::Made yChat 0.5 CURRENT (CVS) compatible to GNU G++ 3.3 and added the "Features" section to the site. Check it out! Also exactly one year ago yChat 0.1 has been released which was the first C++ yChat ever. Happy birthday :-)
::(27.02.04)::Passed the 1000th build breaking point of yChat C++ :-)
::(17.02.04)::Code cleaning in progress! We now focus on fixing scripts and cleaning the sourcecode because we want to release 0.6 some day :-).
::(07.01.04)::yChat 0.5-CURRENT in action: ChatCities decided to use C++ yChat for their Community. This enables to beta test CURRENT and rename it some day to 0.6-RELEASE. See http://www.chatcities.de!  Surprising: Malus started to continue some work on the old Perl based yChat CGI engine. Last version was 0.6.2 (year 2001), he begun to name his version 0.6.3 ;-). See http://chat.spunos.de!  PS: Perl yChat is in german only.
::(03.01.04)::Released yChat Basic 0.5.1. This will be the last official release of the Basic suite and includes all CVS changes which has been made since Basic 0.5 which are mainly bugfixes only.
::(02.01.04)::First, we wish all of you a happy new year!  Second, we decided not to continue the "yChat Basic" branch any more. Instead, we renamed "yChat Advanced" into a simpler and easier to remember "yChat" and keep developing on it.  And last but not least we moved our CVS server and repository to another location. Now we are using a 100% independent developing platform on our own servers. :-) (Check out the CVS Download instructions how to connect to our new CVS server or surf the new online repository at cvsweb.yChat.org)
::(18.12.03)::It's been a while since the last update. I hope that I got some time left in the xmas brake to code on yChat. Maybe we will finish yChat 0.6 Release before the end of 2003.
::(07.11.03)::Added BugReports section.
::(27.10.03)::New site design is online. Added the following sections: Screenshot, Statistics and Copying :-).
::(23.09.03)::Added the "Requirements" section and a guestbook to the site.
::(17.09.03)::The site is now reachable through http://www.yChat.org AND http://www.yhttpd.org. We want to get ready releasing the first version of yhttpd next week.
::(17.09.03)::You might have wondered why we are still releasing new yChat Basic versions (because we told that we won't do this anymore).  The reason is, that we have changed our releasing-model. Now we try to update the Basic branch as well as the Advanced branch.  Nevertheless we try to keep corresponding version numbers. In particular this means, that all major changes or bugfixes which have been made in the Basic 0.6 branch will be included in Advanced 0.6 also.  The same idea will be used in the upcoming yhttpd branch too because yhttpd will be based on yChat Basic!
::(15.09.03)::yChat Suite 0.5 is finally out!  The first version of ychat_advanced and a bugfix release of ychat_basic.  ychat_advanced has the following new features: MySQL Support, improved module-engine, support for different nick/text color, new help system, html site modules, a few new commands, thousands of bugfixes!, Downloads can be found in section "Sourcecode -> Packages"
::(15.09.03)::Added ReleaseHistory section to the site.
::(13.09.03)::It has been a long time the last news have been posted here. But we are heavily developing yChat and plan to release new packages during the next days. Please take a look at the CVS versions.  We also thought that it would be nice starting to work on a small and fast httpd. See ReleasePlans for more informations.
::(26.04.03)::Finally we released the 0.4 version of yChat Basic. Improvements are: Dynamic session support, support for different languages, interface for dynamic module loading and apache style logfiles (combined log-format).  This will be our latest version of the "Basic" series. Only bugfixes and minor improvements will be added to this.  Our new ychat_advanced CVS tree will contain all extended features which we will add in future times.
::(02.04.03)::The documentation section of this homepage has been updated and some minor modifications of the rest of the site has been made.
::(01.04.03)::We have added our project the berlios developer site. ( See http://developer.berlios.de/projects/ychat/ ). Our CVS tree and repository a ( See http://repository.yChat.org/ ) also moved to BerliOS.
